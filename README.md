# CVE-2023-38831

This is an easy to use tool that creates a CVE-2023-38831 exploit that affects all WinRAR versions prior to 6.23.

## Here's more info about the CVE-2023-38831 exploit

> RARLAB WinRAR before 6.23 allows attackers to execute arbitrary code when a user attempts to view a benign file within a ZIP archive. The issue occurs because a ZIP archive may include a benign file (such as an ordinary .JPG file) and also a folder that has the same name as the benign file, and the contents of the folder (which may include executable content) are processed during an attempt to access only the benign file. This was exploited in the wild in April through October 2023.

## How to build

To build the project simply run this command in the project directory.

(*MAKE SURE YOU HAVE CARGO INSTALLED BEFORE RUNNING THIS!*)

```bash
cargo build --release
```

After running this command you'll have an executable located in `target/release` called `winrar-script-exploiter`!

## How-To-Use

Simply run the executable and input all necessary valus.

Try it with some of the demo files in the *demos* folder!
